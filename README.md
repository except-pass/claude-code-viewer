## Overview

Claude Code Viewer has evolved from a simple conversation viewer into a comprehensive web-based Claude Code client. It provides all essential Claude Code functionality through an intuitive web interface, including creating new sessions, resuming conversations, real-time task management, and live synchronization with your local Claude Code projects.

The application leverages Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time bidirectional communication, automatically syncing with JSONL conversation files in `~/.claude/projects/` and providing instant updates as conversations progress.

## Features
